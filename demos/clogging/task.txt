1. There is a new version of jpscore, please pull it to local and compile it.

2. There is a new geometry file for simulation, you need to create new geometry files with different width of the exit according to it.

3. Some parameters in inifile are reset, please using the new one.
The shape of pedestrian is circle, and the radius is 0.2.
	<agent_parameters agent_parameter_id="1">
        <v0 mu="1.34" sigma="0.26" />
        <bmax mu="0.20" sigma="0.00000" /> 
        <bmin mu="0.20" sigma="0.00000" />
        <amin mu="0.20" sigma="0.00000" />
        <atau mu="0.00" sigma="0.00000" />
		<tau mu="0.5" sigma="0.000" />
		<shape circle="1" /> 
     </agent_parameters>
The waiting time before deleting pedestrian in clogging( Tw ) is 2 seconds.
	<waiting_time Tw="2"/> 
The parameters used in direction part and speed part are reset. 
	<time_parameters Td="0.3" Ts="0.3" />
Max simulation time is 500 seconds. 
	<max_sim_time unit="sec">500</max_sim_time>
Each source generate 50 pedestrians. 
	<source id="1" frequency="1" agents_max="50" group_id="0" caption="source 1" greedy="false"  />
	
4. There are five models need to be researched, not four.
M0: simplest (direction=0,speed=0,GCVM=0)
M1: simplest+direction (direction=1,speed=0,GCVM=0)
M2: simplest+velocity (direction=0,speed=1,GCVM=0)
M3: simplest+direction+velocity (direction=1,speed=1,GCVM=0)
M4: GCVM (direcction=1,speed=1,GCVM=1)
you have to study the influence of width of exit, size of the simulation step, update methods, inflow rate of pedestrians for every model, then compare them. 

5. The width of exit are 
[0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 2.5]
when research the influence of other factors, using width=0.8 and width=1.0. 
We have to compare which result is better.

6. The size of the simulation step and the corresponding fps are [size:fps]
[0.01:25, 0.02:25, 0.05:20, 0.1:10, 0.2:5]
when research the influence of other factors, using timestep=0.05,fps=20

7. Update methods are [parallel update, sequential update]
when research the influence of other factors, using parallel update.

8. Inflow rate of pedestrians  are [number of source:the number of pedestrians generated per source] (There may be some problems that require further discussion.)
[2:200,4:100,8:50,16:25] pedestrians/second, but the total number of generated pedestrians should be 400.
when research the influence of other factors, using 8:50.

9. Make the figures obtained looks better, at least can show the full title.

10. Need one more figure to compare the value: (last_clogging_time-first_clogging_time)/(clogging times) for every part mentioned above.
