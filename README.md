## Get the source code

- The project is being developed in a [Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.version.fz-juelich.de/jupedsim/jpscore).
- Our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JuPedSim/jpscore) is used to host selected tags and releases, only.

So, get the code from Gitlab and the releases from GitHub. :-)
