## Introduction

**jpscore** is the core module of [jupedsim](https://www.jupedsim.org/jupedsim_introduction.html) for preforming the simulation (i.e. computing the trajectories).  
This branch is used to demonstrate the work of paper [Prolonged clogs in bottleneck simulations for pedestrian dynamics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437121002065).  
For more information about jupedsim, see [documentation](https://www.jupedsim.org/). 

## Installation

See [Build jupedsim from source](https://www.jupedsim.org/jupedsim_requirements.html) for reference.  
Contact q.xu@fz-juelich.de if you meet any problems.

## Quick start

See [Getting started with jupedsim](http://www.jupedsim.org/jpscore_introduction.html).


## Demos

A demo is provided for testing clogging simulation, which can be found in [demo](https://github.com/xuqiancheng/jpscore/tree/CLOG/demos/scenario_1_clogging).

## Support

We are heavily working on this project which means that:

- It's not done. We will be releasing new enhancements, bug fixes etc.
- We love your support. If you find any errors or have suggestions, please write an issue in our [issue-tracker](https://github.com/JuPedSim/jpscore/issues). We will try hard to fix it.
- Be patient. We are scientists and PhD/master students. Therefore, we primarily care about our research and theses.

If you meet any problems with this branch, feel free to contact q.xu@fz-juelich.de.

Enjoy!
